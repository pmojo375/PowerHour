# PowerHour
This app is my attempt to bring a PowerHour app to the Android platform. I noticed how there are not many (or any) up to date powerhour apps for Android. I also wanted to learn to code apps for Android and sharpen up my Java coding abilities. As a college student who enjoys a brew or two every so often I figured this would be a fun project. In no way to I endorse irresponsible alcohol use and this app is meant to be a learning experience and nothing more than a fun project.

# Features
- Finds and shuffles your music stored on your phone every minute
- Simple clean UI with notification support
- Optional challenges to add a new touch to an old game
- Deselect music based on genre or simply based on induvidual song
- Customizable experience (duration, pause function, sounds at song change, sounds for challenges, etc.)
- Plans to update frequently with new features/bug fixes

# What Works
- The game is in alpha stage and although you can play it with music and all the main features, there are bugs (probably many) and the project is in a very early stage of development.  The music selection and genre selection features cause force closes and not all settings, like the sounds, are implemented fully.  Also, the notification will cause trouble when clicked but will show accurate information.
- Expect many bugs/weird issues

# Changelog
- v0.3.0-alpha
  - Initial release

# Input
Remember I'm new at this but if anyone sees any faults in my code I am open to any and all suggestions and input. My hope is to put this on the Play Store with ads for some slight revenue (sorry, poor college student!) and have an ad free version for $1
